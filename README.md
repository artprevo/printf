# printf
Recoding of printf, the system function.

Really long project, took us a month to have a proper version. 
Huge work of parsing and processing. Have to code every rules and be aware of every exception.
Linked-list were used to achieve this program. 

The plan is : it parses, it converts any input in char*, applyes any setting, then print.

Quite simple but really exhaustive.
